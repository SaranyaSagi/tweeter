# Tweeter Project

➡️ Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Having been provided with starter code, was able to build upon it using front end skills such as HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX and Node, Express back-end skills. 

Tweeter has a text box and a counter that checks if text meets the limit and alerts user accordingly if tweets are invalid. There are two toggle buttons one that is animated and makes accessing tweet box easy by sliding it down when clicked and the other brings the user to the top of the page when clicked. 

Javascript used to safely render insecure text by escaping XSS.The best part is Tweeter is responsive across various devices of different screen sizes.
